Experiment 4
Create a simple feature that displays a live character count as the user types in a textarea. This helps you practice real-time event handling and dynamic content updates to improve user interaction.

Overview
In this experiment, I created  a simple feature that displays a live character count as the user types in a textarea

HTML Structure:

1. <!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
2. <html>: This is the root element of the entire HTML page. All other elements are nested inside of it.
3. <head>: This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, which is not displayed on the web page itself. It includes the character set, title, and styling.
4. <meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that can represent almost all characters and symbols.
5. <title>: Sets the title of the HTML page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

Inside body tag :

1. A **main outer div** called `outer_div` to hold everything inside one box.  
2. A <h2> heading with text "Live Character Count".  
3. A <textarea> where user can type text. This textarea has an id="inputarea" and oninput="showcount()" event.  
    `id` is a unique name for an element so we can find it later in css or js.
    oninput` means whenever user types or deletes something, the function is called.  
4. A <span id="Counter">0</span> which shows the live count of characters.  

JavaScript Logic :  

The Function 

I made a function named **showcount()**. It runs every time user types something in textarea.  

javascript

function showcount() {
    const textarea = document.getElementById("inputarea");
    const count = textarea.value.length;

    const counter = document.getElementById("Counter");
    counter.textContent = count;
}
 
In this function getElementById is used to refference the tag to some const or variable .

"Value" is used to access the message inside the text area .

"Length " is used to count the number of character inside the text area.

Basic CSS : 

-  use of basic css properties like 
   - height                                  Set the height  of outer and textbox .
   - width                                   Set the width
   - border                                  Create a border around the div
   - border-radius                           To curve the egde of the border.
   - display : flex                          To display the content is row and column.
   - text-align                              To align the text.

   Learning outcomes: 

1. Got familiar with HTML structure (head, body, div, textarea, span).
2. Understood how to use the id attribute to target elements.
3. Learned about oninput event for live updates.
4. Explored JavaScript DOM methods, specially getElementById.
5. Learned about .value and .length properties of textarea.
